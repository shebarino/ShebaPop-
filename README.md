# ShebaPop!
<font size="3px">The official ShebaBancho Chrome extension!</font>

**What the fuck is the point in this extension?**<br>
If you just want to be able to navigate through ShebaBancho in a quick and easy way, the extension is for you. It is still a WIP, but I can assure that it will be very simple and fun to navigate through. <br><br>

**I still don't get it. Why not just go to the website? The domain is easy as fuck anyways?**<br>
idk lol, i sniff socks for a living

**This project uses Hover.css which can be found <a href="https://github.com/IanLunn/Hover">here</a>.**
<br><br>
**The guest avatar is from the osu! website, which can be found <a href="https://github.com/ppy/osu-web">here</a>.**

**ShebaPop!**  uses **HTML**, **CSS** & **JS**. If you need help with modifying this, look towards learning the simple first. If It's too "hard", you should leave it alone.
